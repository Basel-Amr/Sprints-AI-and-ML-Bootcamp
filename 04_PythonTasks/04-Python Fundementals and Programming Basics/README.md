# FizzBuzz Control Flow üöÄ

## Overview
This project implements the classic FizzBuzz problem to practice control flow concepts in Python, including conditional statements, loops, and user input validation.
---
## Features
‚úî Conditional Logic: Uses if-elif-else to determine Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz conditions.
‚úî Looping Mechanism: Iterates over a predefined range (1-100) and applies FizzBuzz logic.
‚úî User Interaction: Allows users to enter a custom range with validation for robust input handling.

## How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Runs FizzBuzz for numbers 1 to 100 automatically.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Prompts the user to enter a custom range.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensures valid integer input with error handling.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Displays Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz based on divisibility rules.

## Usage

```bash
python fizzbuzz.py
```
