Task Name : Utilize Specialized Collections
Task Number : 14
Part : Exception Handling
Module : Python Programming Language for AI / ML
Submit_Number : 1

Description:
This task introduces students to the specialized collections in Pythonâ€™s collections module.
They will apply collections like Counter, namedtuple, deque, OrderedDict, and defaultdict to solve real-world problems.

Requirement 1:
Description: Use the Counter class to count the frequency of words in a given text file.

Requirement 2:
Description: Create a namedtuple to store information about a book (e.g., title, author, year, ISBN).


Requirement 3:
Description: Use deque to implement a queue where you enqueue and dequeue elements efficiently.
