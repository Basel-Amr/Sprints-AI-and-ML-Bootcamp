In the town of Athy one Jeremy Lanigan
Battered away till he hadn't a pound.
His father died and made him a man again,
Left him a farm and ten acres of ground.
He gave a grand party to friends and relations
Who didn't forget to make their attentions.
In the town of Athy one Jeremy Lanigan
He gave a grand party to friends and relations again again again again again again
