Task Name : File Handling - Working with Threads and APIs
Task Number : 19
Part :  File Handling
Module : Python Programming Language for AI / ML
Submit_Number : 1

Description:
This task covers creating and managing threads to handle concurrent operations.
It also covers how to interact with web APIs using the requests module.

Requirement 1:
Description: 
Create a program that downloads multiple files concurrently using Pythonâ€™s threading module.

Requirement 2:
Description: 
Use the requests module to interact with a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).
Fetch a list of posts and display the title of each post.

Requirement 3:
Description: 
Create a program that fetches data from multiple APIs concurrently using threads and prints the results.
