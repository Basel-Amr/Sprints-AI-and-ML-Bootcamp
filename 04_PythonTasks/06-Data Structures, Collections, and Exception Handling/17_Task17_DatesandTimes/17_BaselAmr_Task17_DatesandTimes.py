This task focuses on performing date/time operations using Pythonâ€™s datetime and calendar modules.
Students will practice working with date/time objects and performing arithmetic on dates.

Requirement 1:
Description: 
Create a datetime object for the current date and time. Format the date as YYYY-MM-DD and time as HH:MM:SS.

Requirement 2:
Description: 
Calculate the date 10 days from today and the date 10 days ago. Display both dates.
